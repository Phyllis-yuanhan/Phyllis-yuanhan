## ðŸ“Š Data Science Projects

- ***(On Going Project) SignSpeak: AI-Driven Sign Language Interpretation***: This project pioneers in developing an automated detection system for translating American and British Sign Language gestures to text. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), this project targets surpassing 92% accuracy by addressing the challenges of diverse backgrounds and skin tones. Through extensive dataset enrichment and innovative preprocessing techniques, this project aims to revolutionize sign language translation by enhancing model adaptability and setting new benchmarks in accuracy and generalization across sign languages.

- ***(On Going Project) Finance Forecaster: NLP-Powered Investment Strategy Development***: This project applies NLP techniques to analyze earnings call transcripts of public companies to develop investment strategies. Participants will preprocess data, implement TF-IDF, use Word2Vec for semantic analysis, and employ Sentence-BERT in a Retrieval Augmented Generation framework. The final task involves constructing a trading strategy using ML classification, with performance evaluated against a baseline for potential grading benefits. Submissions include code notebooks and results in specified formats.

- [Advanced Earnings Prediction: Enhanced Models and Accuracy Assessment](https://github.com/Phyllis-yuanhan/Advanced-Earnings-Prediction): This group project integrates Compustat and IBES data to refine earnings forecasting models including HVZ, earnings persistence, and residual income. Analysis spans 2010-2019 data for model comparison, extending to 2020-2022 for accuracy assessment. Additional factors, extracted from the Compustat dataset, are integrated to enhance the best-performing model. Forecasts for 2020 EPS are compared with analyst predictions, and top-performing firms for 2023 earnings growth are identified and pitched based on qualitative factors.
  
- [Financial Forensics: Advanced Analytics for Forecasting Financial Restatement](https://github.com/Phyllis-yuanhan/Advanced-Analytics-for-Forecasting-Financial-Restatement): This project delves into fraud detection using Compustat and Audit Analytics datasets. It assesses earnings quality (EQ) and predicts potential restatements among US exchange-listed firms from 2010-2022. The analysis includes comparing EQ between restating and non-restating firms, incorporating predictive factors beyond abnormal accruals, and applying coefficients to predict future restatements. An annual Earnings Management (EM) index is created to identify firms at risk of restating financials in 2021.

- [Deliverying Fresh Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Phyllis-yuanhan/Deliverying-Fresh-Customer-Segmentation): In this group project, our team launched a business idea centered on delivering organic meal kits, customizing services to meet diverse customer preferences. Utilizing Census Canada 2021 data, we applied KMeans clustering for customer segmentation analysis and then developed segmentation models to predict Median Household Income, employing techniques such as Lasso Regression and ANN. As the data science lead, my role encompasses all aspects from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering and modelling.

- [Prediction of Corruption Perception Index](https://github.com/Phyllis-yuanhan/Prediction-of-Corruption-Perception-Index.git): This project aimed to predict a country's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) using machine learning. Analyzing data from 2012 to 2020 across 196 countries, the study found that legal system & property rights, GNI per capita, and education levels were significant predictors of CPI. The lasso regression model was identified as the most effective for CPI prediction, suggesting that improvements in these areas can lead to a reduction in perceived corruption.

- [Time Series Forcasting in Cryptocurrency_Machine Learning](https://github.com/Phyllis-yuanhan/SURP-Time-Series-in-Cryptocurrency--Machine-Learning): This independent research project explores forecasting Dogecoin's closing price using ARIMA, SARIMAX, KNN, Random Forest, and SVM models. The study identifies the SVM model as the most effective, with approximately 96.8% accuracy in out-of-sample forecasts. (This is conducted during the Summer Undergraduate Research Program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022)
