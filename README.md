## ðŸ“Š Data Science Projects

- [Deliverying Fresh Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Phyllis-yuanhan/Deliverying-Fresh-Customer-Segmentation): In this group project, we launched a business idea centered on delivering organic meal kits, customizing services to meet diverse customer preferences. Utilizing Census Canada 2021 data, we applied KMeans clustering for customer segmentation analysis and then developed segmentation models to predict Median Household Income, employing techniques such as Lasso Regression and ANN. As the data science lead, my role encompasses all aspects from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering and modelling.

- [Prediction of Corruption Perception Index](https://github.com/Phyllis-yuanhan/Prediction-of-Corruption-Perception-Index.git): This project aimed to predict a country's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) using machine learning. Analyzing data from 2012 to 2020 across 196 countries, the study found that legal system & property rights, GNI per capita, and education levels were significant predictors of CPI. The lasso regression model was identified as the most effective for CPI prediction, suggesting that improvements in these areas can lead to a reduction in perceived corruption.

- [Time Series Forcasting in Cryptocurrency_Machine Learning](https://github.com/Phyllis-yuanhan/SURP-Time-Series-in-Cryptocurrency--Machine-Learning): This independent research project explores forecasting Dogecoin's closing price using ARIMA, SARIMAX, KNN, Random Forest, and SVM models. The study identifies the SVM model as the most effective, with approximately 96.8% accuracy in out-of-sample forecasts. (This is conducted during the Summer Undergraduate Research Program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022)
